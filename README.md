  by dishsoapman

usage:
  use any shield and sprint + block with shield + jump + drop shield to start surfing
  w to jump, s to brake, a and d to steer
  crouch to dismount
  
 known issues:
  shield steering will stutter, slow down, or not work at all at lower speeds
  have not added proper physics for shield rolling(?) down inclined surfaces (slabs, stairs)
